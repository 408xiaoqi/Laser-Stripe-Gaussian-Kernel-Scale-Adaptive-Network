# Laser-Stripe-Gaussian-Kernel-Scale-Adaptive-Network
Used for inferring the required Gaussian kernel scale for different laser stripes.
Prepare a dataset in the format: 51_5.png 51, where the former is the image name, and the latter represents the full width and half the height.
You only need to install the required packages and set the dataset path to start training.
